# Meetups

The texts, images, schedules, ideas, suggestions for the meetups.

## Ideas & suggestions

- More small live tutorials
- Ask the community what they would like to discuss/learn and find people that would like to present based on that
- Do a small patch-a-thon
- Put out a challenge to work with only a subset of max objects
- Live coding with max short challenges (6 minute patching with timer)
- Some live performances instead of presentations (maybe as a different type of event)

**Add ideas or suggestions**

Create a Github account. Click the README.md file and proceed to edit (Github forks the project for you). Put in the text you want to have added, make adjustments to other text if you think something needs to be changed. Check the result in the `Preview changes`. Afterwards add a description to your commit and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) by clicking `propose file change`.
