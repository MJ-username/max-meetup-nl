# Meetups

The texts, images, schedules, ideas, suggestions for the meetups.

## Ideas & suggestions

- More small live tutorials
- Ask the community what they would like to discuss/learn and find people that would like to present based on that
- Do a small patch-a-thon
- Put out a challenge to work with only a subset of max objects
- Live coding with max short challenges (6 minute patching with timer)
- Some live performances instead of presentations (maybe as a different type of event)
