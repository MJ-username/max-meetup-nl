Max Meetup @ Havenloods, Utrecht with CCU
Saturday 25 January 15h - 19h

Hi everyone,

I'm planning on organizing a Max-Meetup on January 25 at the Havenloods in Utrecht together with Fabian from Creative Coding Utrecht. The idea at the moment is to have the meetup start around 15h and end around 19h. This should give most people some room to travel. At the moment the content of the meetup is yet to be decided, but I was thinking to have a few 20-30 minute presentations(incl Q&A), as well as a few short live-tutorials and maybe an open patching-workspace where everyone can do whatever (share knowledge, patches, techniques, ask questions, work on something, etc.). I'm also thinking about ending the meetup with some live-coding from scratch in (vanilla)-Max performances? We can conclude the evening with the option to order some food together (for those interested), or just drink some beers and everyone will go there seperate way.

We will ask €5 entrance to cover the rent for the space and have a small fee available for the people presenting. Drinks will be around €2.

Feel free to send me a message if you are interested in presenting your project. In my opinion the presentation should also have a part where you actually show your patch and the contents of it.
